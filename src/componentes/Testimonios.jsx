                speechless with how easy this was to integrate within my
                application. Most templates are a pain, code is scattered, and
                near impossible to theme.

                Flowbite has code in one place and I'm not joking when I say it
                took me a matter of minutes to copy the code, customise it and
                integrate within a Laravel + Vue application.
